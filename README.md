TrelloMite
==========

Simple .NET library to connect Trello (https://trello.com/) to Mite (https://mite.yo.lk/) by parsing Trello cards & comments for specific time-tracking commands.

Makes heavy use of  https://github.com/dillenmeister/Trello.NET and https://github.com/ccellar/mite.net. Since both libraries had bugs and/or missing features I'm using custom builds at the moment, instead of the NuGet packages. This will change as soon as my pull requests are accepted or the features/bugfixes have been added.
